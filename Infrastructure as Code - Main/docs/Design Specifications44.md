### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

This repository is the cornerstone of the entire system's cloud presence. Its design must prioritize modularity, security, and state management to prevent configuration drift and enable safe, automated changes. The complexity necessitates splitting Terraform state by environment and major component to manage blast radius and improve performance.

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-089

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

Cloud infrastructure shall be managed using an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach (e.g., Terraform).

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The entire repository is dedicated to fulfilling this requirement.
- Requires a strict, version-controlled workflow for all infrastructure changes.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- Terraform Modules (VPC, EKS, RDS)
- Environment Root Modules (dev, stage, prod)

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the foundational requirement that mandates the existence and purpose of this repository.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

ARCHITECTURE-INFRASTRUCTURE-LAYER

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

Provision all components of the Infrastructure & Data Persistence Layer (PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Redis, S3, QLDB, Keycloak on EKS).

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires creation of specific Terraform modules for 'aws_rds_cluster', 'aws_elasticache_cluster', 'aws_s3_bucket', 'aws_qldb_ledger', and 'aws_eks_cluster'.
- Infrastructure for Keycloak will involve provisioning EKS resources and the necessary IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA).

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- RDS Module
- ElastiCache Module
- S3 Module
- EKS Module

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The repository must translate the logical architecture for data and persistence into concrete, provisioned AWS resources.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Availability

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-084: The system must be deployed across multiple AWS Availability Zones.

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

Terraform resources such as VPC subnets, EKS Node Groups, and RDS clusters ('multi_az = true') must be explicitly configured to span at least two AZs.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Networking design must include public and private subnets in each AZ.
- Stateful services must use multi-AZ configurations provided by AWS.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR directly translates to specific required arguments and architectural patterns within the HCL code.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Disaster Recovery

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-045: The system must support a documented Disaster Recovery plan.

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The Terraform code must be parameterized (e.g., for AWS region) to allow recreation of the entire stack in a DR region. Resources like RDS and S3 must be configured for cross-region replication.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- Hardcoded region-specific values (like AMIs) must be avoided.
- A separate state backend must be maintained for the DR environment.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

IaC is the primary tactic for DR. The sequence diagram for DR ('id: 99') explicitly relies on 'Terraform (IaC)' to rebuild the environment.

### 3.2.3.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.3.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-081: All data must be encrypted at rest.

#### 3.2.3.3.0 Implementation Impact

All storage-related resources (e.g., 'aws_db_instance', 'aws_s3_bucket', 'aws_ebs_volume') must have their encryption arguments enabled ('storage_encrypted = true'). This may require the creation and management of KMS keys ('aws_kms_key').

#### 3.2.3.4.0 Design Constraints

- Default encryption settings must be enforced.
- IAM policies must be configured to manage access to KMS keys.

#### 3.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This security control must be implemented at the resource definition level within Terraform, making it non-negotiable and auditable.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository's structure and code are heavily dictated by non-functional requirements. Availability, security, and disaster recovery are not features to be added later; they are core constraints that shape the definition of every resource from networking to data stores.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The entire repository is an implementation of IaC, using Terraform's declarative language to define, provision, and manage the lifecycle of AWS infrastructure.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- Terraform CLI
- AWS Provider
- Git for version control

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

A modular approach will be used, with reusable modules for distinct services (VPC, EKS, RDS) composed within environment-specific root configurations.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is mandated by REQ-1-089 and is essential for achieving automated, repeatable, and version-controlled infrastructure management.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Modular Infrastructure (Terraform Modules)

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

Infrastructure is broken down into logical, reusable components (e.g., a VPC, a database, a Kubernetes cluster) encapsulated in Terraform modules.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- A 'modules/' directory containing subdirectories for each module.
- Well-defined 'variables.tf' (inputs) and 'outputs.tf' (outputs) for each module.

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Each module will be self-contained and versionable. Root modules in the 'environments/' directory will compose these child modules to build a complete environment.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Modularity is critical for managing the complexity of the system, promoting reuse, and enabling independent testing and development of infrastructure components.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

### 4.2.1.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.1.1.0 Integration Type

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

State Management Strategy

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

A monolithic Terraform state for the entire system will become a significant performance bottleneck and operational risk. A strategy for splitting the state is not explicitly defined but is critical for success.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

Without state splitting, 'terraform plan' times will become unacceptably long, and the blast radius of any single change or state corruption event will be the entire system.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Based on the scope of infrastructure to be managed, a single state file is untenable. The repository structure must enforce state separation by environment and logical component (e.g., networking, cluster, data-services).

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Security

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

The repository will define critical IAM policies and security groups. There must be a mandatory, automated security scanning step in the CI/CD pipeline before any 'apply' is permitted.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

Without automated checks (e.g., using tfsec or checkov), insecure configurations such as overly permissive IAM roles or open security groups could easily be deployed to production.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

IaC makes security policies auditable but also makes it easy to deploy misconfigurations at scale. Preventative, automated scanning is a mandatory control.

## 7.3.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.3.1.0.0 Finding Category

Secret Management

### 7.3.2.0.0 Finding Description

The Terraform code will need to handle secrets, such as initial database passwords. These must not be stored in plaintext in the repository or state file.

### 7.3.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

Plaintext secrets in version control are a severe security vulnerability. The code must integrate with a secrets management tool like AWS Secrets Manager to provide secrets to resources at creation time.

### 7.3.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.3.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

The architecture specifies AWS Secrets Manager, and the IaC repository must be the primary point of integration for provisioning secrets and configuring resources to use them.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis directly maps the logical components from the Architecture document to physical Terraform resources. NFRs for Security, Availability, and DR were used to define specific configuration requirements. The DR sequence diagram (id: 99) was used to confirm the role of this repository in the recovery process.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: Recommend a split-state strategy based on the high complexity and broad scope of the infrastructure.
- Decision: Emphasize modular design using the 'modules/' and 'environments/' structure as it aligns with Terraform best practices and maintainability requirements.
- Decision: Identify automated security scanning as a critical finding due to the security-sensitive nature of the resources being managed.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption: The CI/CD environment will have secure access to AWS credentials via an IAM Role.
- Assumption: The remote backend infrastructure (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table) will be created manually as a one-time bootstrap process or via a separate, smaller Terraform configuration.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that every service listed in the 'Infrastructure & Data Persistence Layer' has a corresponding implementation path via an AWS resource managed by this repository.
- Confirmed that the IaC approach mandated by REQ-1-089 is consistent with the tooling specified in the 'Cross-Cutting Concerns' layer.
