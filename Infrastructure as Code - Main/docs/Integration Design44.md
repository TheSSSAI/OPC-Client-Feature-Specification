## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-089

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system shall be implemented using the specified technology stack. Key components include: ... DevOps (GitHub Actions, Terraform)...

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- All cloud resources (EKS, RDS, S3, etc.) must be defined in Terraform HCL.
- Infrastructure provisioning and updates must be repeatable and automatable through the CI/CD pipeline.
- A remote state backend (e.g., S3) must be used for collaboration and state management.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- This repository will be the single source of truth for the cloud environment's configuration.
- Changes to infrastructure must go through a version-controlled, peer-review process within this repository.
- The CI/CD pipeline repository (REPO-CICD-PIPELINES) will depend on this repository to execute infrastructure changes.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is explicitly mapped to the repository and defines its core purpose and technology choice. It is the central driver for the repository's existence.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-084

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The Central Management Plane shall achieve a service level availability of at least 99.9%... All planned maintenance must be communicated... not exceed a total of 4 hours in any calendar month.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- The VPC networking must span at least two, preferably three, AWS Availability Zones.
- The EKS Node Groups must be configured to launch instances across multiple AZs.
- The RDS database instance must be configured for Multi-AZ deployment.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- Terraform code must define subnets in different AZs.
- The `aws_eks_node_group` resource must specify multiple subnet IDs from different AZs.
- The `aws_db_instance` or `aws_rds_cluster` resource must have the `multi_az` parameter set to true.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This high-availability requirement is directly implemented at the infrastructure level. The Terraform code in this repository is responsible for defining the multi-AZ topology for all critical components.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-081

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

All data at rest must be encrypted using the AES-256 standard... Highly sensitive information... must be securely stored and retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- RDS database storage must be encrypted.
- S3 buckets must have server-side encryption enabled by default.
- EBS volumes used by EKS nodes must be encrypted.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The `aws_db_instance` resource must have `storage_encrypted` set to true.
- The `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration` resource must be applied to all buckets.
- The EKS node group configuration or the underlying AMI must enforce EBS encryption.
- Initial database passwords and other secrets must be provisioned in AWS Secrets Manager and referenced by other resources, not stored in plaintext.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This security requirement is enforced through the configuration of the cloud resources. This repository is the place where this configuration is defined and managed as code.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

### 1.3.1.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.1.1 Component Name

EKS Cluster

#### 1.3.1.2 Component Specification

Provides the Kubernetes orchestration runtime for all containerized microservices of the Central Management Plane.

#### 1.3.1.3 Implementation Requirements

- Define the EKS control plane, node groups across multiple AZs, and associated IAM roles using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA).
- Configure networking (e.g., AWS VPC CNI) and cluster autoscaling.
- Output the cluster endpoint and authentication configuration for use by the CI/CD pipeline.

#### 1.3.1.4 Architectural Context

Belongs to the Infrastructure & Data Persistence Layer. This is the primary execution environment for the Application Services Layer.

#### 1.3.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a core piece of infrastructure that must be defined by this repository to fulfill the cloud-native architecture specified in REQ-1-021.

### 1.3.2.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.2.1 Component Name

RDS for PostgreSQL & TimescaleDB

#### 1.3.2.2 Component Specification

Provides the managed relational and time-series database for the Central Management Plane.

#### 1.3.2.3 Implementation Requirements

- Provision an AWS RDS instance with the PostgreSQL engine and the TimescaleDB extension enabled.
- Configure for high availability using Multi-AZ deployment as per REQ-1-084.
- Manage instance size, storage, security groups, and enforce encryption at rest as per REQ-1-081.
- Securely manage the master password via AWS Secrets Manager and provide the secret's ARN as an output.

#### 1.3.2.4 Architectural Context

Belongs to the Infrastructure & Data Persistence Layer. This component directly supports the persistence needs of multiple microservices.

#### 1.3.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

The architecture explicitly calls for PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB on AWS RDS (REQ-1-089). This repository is responsible for provisioning and managing this critical stateful service.

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Infrastructure & Data Persistence Layer', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Provides all data stores, caches, identity providers, and cloud infrastructure for persistence, storage, and runtime orchestration.', 'layer_constraints': ['All resources must be defined as code.', 'Secrets and credentials must not be hardcoded in the Terraform files and must be managed via AWS Secrets Manager.', 'Networking must be secure, following the principle of least privilege for security groups and network ACLs.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Modular Terraform design (e.g., modules for VPC, EKS, RDS).', 'Use of Terraform workspaces or directories to manage different environments (staging, production).', 'Remote state backend with state locking to prevent conflicts.'], 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository is the concrete implementation of this architectural layer, as defined in the architecture document. Its entire scope is to define and manage the resources described by this layer's responsibilities."}

## 1.5.0.0 Dependency Interfaces

*No items available*

## 1.6.0.0 Exposed Interfaces

- {'interface_name': 'Cloud Infrastructure Outputs', 'consumer_repositories': ['REPO-CICD-PIPELINES'], 'method_contracts': [{'method_name': 'Terraform Output Consumption', 'method_signature': 'data "terraform_remote_state" "infra" { ... }', 'method_purpose': 'To allow other systems, primarily the CI/CD pipeline, to programmatically read the details of the provisioned infrastructure (e.g., cluster endpoints, database hostnames, S3 bucket names) for configuration and deployment of applications.', 'implementation_requirements': 'The CI/CD pipeline (REPO-CICD-PIPELINES) must have IAM permissions to read the Terraform state from the S3 backend.'}], 'service_level_requirements': ['The outputs must be accurate and reflect the current state of the deployed infrastructure.', 'The remote state must be available and accessible to authorized consumers.'], 'implementation_constraints': ['Explicit `output` blocks must be defined in the Terraform code for all values needed by consumer systems.', 'Sensitive values like database passwords must not be passed directly as Terraform outputs. Instead, the ARN of the corresponding secret in AWS Secrets Manager must be outputted.'], 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository's primary contract with the rest of the system is to expose the details of the infrastructure it creates. The CI/CD pipeline (REPO-CICD-PIPELINES) is the main consumer and is completely dependent on these outputs to function, bridging the gap between infrastructure provisioning and application deployment."}

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

Terraform v1.9.0 must be used for all infrastructure definitions, written in HCL v2.

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- AWS Provider for Terraform v5.58.0
- Amazon S3 (for remote state backend)
- Amazon DynamoDB (for state locking)

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints

Not applicable for the IaC code itself, but the provisioned infrastructure must meet the performance requirements of the application (e.g., proper instance sizing for RDS and EKS nodes). The Terraform state should be split by environment to ensure `plan` and `apply` operations remain performant.

### 1.7.4.0 Security Requirements

All IAM roles and policies must adhere to the principle of least privilege. All security group rules must be as restrictive as possible. Secrets must not be stored in plaintext in the repository and must be managed via AWS Secrets Manager (REQ-1-081).
