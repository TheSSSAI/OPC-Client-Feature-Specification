Infrastructure as Code - Main

# 3 Description

This repository contains all the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) definitions for deploying and managing the cloud infrastructure on AWS. Using Terraform, as specified in REQ-1-089, this repository defines all cloud resources, including the Amazon EKS cluster for Kubernetes orchestration, RDS instances for PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB, ElastiCache for Redis, S3 buckets for object storage, and all necessary networking (VPC, subnets, security groups) and IAM roles. It provides a version-controlled, repeatable, and automated way to provision and update the entire cloud environment, ensuring consistency across deployments (e.g., staging, production) and facilitating disaster recovery. This repository is fundamental to the system's operational stability and scalability.

# 23.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 23.1.0 Must Implement

- Definition of all AWS resources (EKS, RDS, VPC, S3, etc.).
- Configuration of networking and security policies.
- Management of different environments (staging, prod) using Terraform workspaces or directory structures.
- Output of critical connection details (e.g., database endpoints) for use by application deployment pipelines.

## 23.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Deployment of applications (this is handled by CI/CD pipelines using Kubernetes manifests/Helm).
- Management of the observability stack (this is in a separate IaC repository).
- Storage of any application code.

## 23.3.0 Integration Points

- AWS API.
- Terraform state backend (S3).

## 23.4.0 Architectural Constraints

- Code must be modular and reusable (e.g., using Terraform modules).
- Secrets must not be hardcoded; they should be retrieved from a secure source like AWS Secrets Manager at deploy time.

# 25.0.0 Cognitive Load Instructions

## 25.1.0 Sds Generation Guidance

### 25.1.1 Focus Areas

- The modular structure of the Terraform code.
- The networking design (VPC, subnets, NAT gateways).
- The configuration of the EKS cluster and its node groups.

### 25.1.2 Avoid Patterns

- Creating a single, monolithic Terraform file for the entire infrastructure.

## 25.2.0 Code Generation Guidance

### 25.2.1 Implementation Patterns

- Use variables and `.tfvars` files to manage environment-specific configurations.
