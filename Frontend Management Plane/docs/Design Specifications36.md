### 7.1.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The security of the entire application hinges on the correct and secure implementation of the OIDC client-side flow and subsequent handling of JWTs. Storing tokens in localStorage is unacceptable and must be avoided.

### 7.1.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

A dedicated 'AuthService' module and secure state management approach (in-memory via Redux/Context) are required. Failure to implement this correctly could expose user sessions to XSS attacks.

### 7.1.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

A breach in client-side token management would compromise the entire security model of the system for that user.

## 7.2.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Performance

### 7.2.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The application is data-intensive, with requirements to display real-time streams, historical trends, and potentially large asset hierarchies. Without proper optimization, the UI will suffer from poor performance.

### 7.2.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

Implementation must prioritize performance patterns: server-state caching (React Query), list virtualization ('react-window'), code-splitting ('React.lazy'), and use of concurrent features ('startTransition').

### 7.2.4.0.0.0 Priority Level
