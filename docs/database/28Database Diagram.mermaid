This entity relationship diagram illustrates the structure of the LogEntry document within the Observability Log Store. It details the various fields captured for each log, such as timestamp, level, service name, and correlation IDs, which are indexed for efficient searching and analysis. The design is optimized for a search database like OpenSearch, treating each log as an independent document without traditional relational constraints.
