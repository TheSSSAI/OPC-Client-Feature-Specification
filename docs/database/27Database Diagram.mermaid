This diagram illustrates the structure of the AuditRecord entity within the Amazon QLDB ledger. It is designed as a standalone table to store immutable, cryptographically verifiable audit trail documents. Each record corresponds to an entry in a relational AuditLog table, linked by the 'auditLogId'. As there are no other entities or relationships defined in this schema, it is depicted as a single entity.
