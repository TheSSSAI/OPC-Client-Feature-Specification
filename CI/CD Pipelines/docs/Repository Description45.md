# 2 Name

CI/CD Pipelines

# 3 Description

This repository centralizes the definition of all Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows for the entire system, using GitHub Actions as specified in REQ-1-089. It is responsible for automating the build, testing, containerization, and deployment of all microservices and the frontend application. Workflows defined here are triggered by code commits and pull requests to the application repositories. Key responsibilities include running unit and integration tests (REQ-1-086), performing static code analysis, building and pushing Docker images to a container registry, and deploying applications to the Kubernetes cluster. This repository ensures that all software changes are delivered in a consistent, reliable, and automated fashion.

# 23.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 23.1.0 Must Implement

- CI workflows for all services, frontend, and edge client.
- CD workflows for deploying to staging and production environments.
- Automated execution of unit, integration, and performance tests (REQ-NFR-008).
- Secrets management for deployment credentials.
- Reusable workflows for common tasks (e.g., .NET build, Docker push).

## 23.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Infrastructure provisioning (handled by REPO-IAC-MAIN).
- The application source code itself.
- Manual deployment procedures.

## 23.3.0 Integration Points

- GitHub for source code and triggers.
- Container Registry (e.g., Amazon ECR) for storing images.
- Kubernetes cluster for deployments.

## 23.4.0 Architectural Constraints

- Pipelines must include a manual approval step for production deployments.
- Deployment strategies like blue-green or canary should be used to minimize downtime.

# 25.0.0 Cognitive Load Instructions

## 25.1.0 Sds Generation Guidance

### 25.1.1 Focus Areas

- The structure of the reusable workflows.
- The deployment strategy for microservices (e.g., Helm charts).
- The environment promotion strategy (Dev -> Staging -> Prod).

### 25.1.2 Avoid Patterns

- Copy-pasting entire workflow logic for each service.

## 25.2.0 Code Generation Guidance

### 25.2.1 Implementation Patterns

- Define standardized YAML templates for different application types (.NET service, React app).
