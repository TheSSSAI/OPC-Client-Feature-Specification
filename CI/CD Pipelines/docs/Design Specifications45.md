# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-086

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

All software components must be built, tested, and deployed using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Create distinct GitHub Actions workflows for Continuous Integration (triggered by pull requests) and Continuous Deployment (triggered by merges to main).
- CI workflows must include jobs for building, running unit/integration tests, and static analysis.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- ci.yml
- cd.yml
- reusable-workflows

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary functional requirement this repository exists to fulfill. The entire structure is designed around implementing these automated processes.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-093

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

All code must have a minimum of 80% unit test coverage.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The CI workflow must include a step that calculates code coverage after running unit tests.
- A subsequent script step must parse the coverage report and fail the workflow if the 80% threshold is not met, blocking the PR.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- ci.yml
- test-and-coverage-script

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The CI/CD pipeline is the automated enforcement mechanism for this quality gate. It provides immediate feedback to developers on compliance.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-082

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

The system must support a secure provisioning workflow for new OPC Core Clients.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- A dedicated release workflow must be created to build, containerize, and version the OPC Core Client software.
- This workflow will publish the Docker image artifact to a container registry, which is a prerequisite for the remote update sequence (SEQ-84).

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- release-opc-client.yml

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

While the full provisioning sequence involves more components, the CI/CD pipeline is responsible for securely preparing the software artifact that gets provisioned and updated.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

Enforce encryption in transit, at rest, and manage secrets securely (REQ-1-081). Use centralized authentication and RBAC (REQ-1-080).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The pipeline architecture must completely avoid long-lived static credentials. All interactions with cloud providers like AWS must use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for dynamic, short-lived credentials.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Must use GitHub Secrets for storing any necessary tokens (e.g., Snyk token).
- Each workflow job must define the minimum required 'permissions' for its GITHUB_TOKEN.
- Docker images must be scanned for vulnerabilities before being pushed to the registry.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The CI/CD pipeline has privileged access to source code and production environments, making it a high-value target. A 'secure by default' posture using native platform features like OIDC is non-negotiable.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Maintainability

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

Adopt a microservices architecture with loosely coupled, independently deployable services (REQ-1-086).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The pipeline design must avoid monolithic workflow files. Common logic for build, test, scan, and deploy stages must be extracted into reusable workflows or composite actions.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- A central library of reusable workflows will be created in '.github/workflows/reusable/'.
- Application-specific pipeline files will be thin orchestrators that call these reusable components with appropriate parameters.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

To support dozens of microservices, a modular pipeline design is essential for maintainability, consistency, and rapid onboarding of new services.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository's primary mandate is to implement REQ-1-086 by creating a robust, automated delivery system. This system must be architected to enforce other key requirements, particularly security (OIDC, scanning) and quality (test coverage), while remaining maintainable through a modular, reusable design pattern.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Pipeline as Code

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

All CI/CD processes are defined declaratively in YAML files stored and versioned in a Git repository.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- /.github/workflows/

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Leverage GitHub Actions' native YAML syntax to define triggers, jobs, steps, and environment configurations. All changes to the pipeline are reviewed and merged via pull requests.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern provides auditability, repeatability, and disaster recovery for the entire software delivery process, aligning with cloud-native best practices.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Modular Pipelines

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

Common pipeline stages (e.g., build .NET app, deploy with Helm) are encapsulated into self-contained, reusable components that can be invoked by multiple top-level workflows.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- /.github/workflows/reusable/
- /.github/actions/

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Use 'workflow_call' (reusable workflows) for multi-job stages and composite actions for bundling sequences of steps. Top-level workflows will primarily orchestrate calls to these reusable components.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is critical for satisfying the Maintainability NFR in a microservices architecture. It prevents configuration drift and reduces code duplication, making the system easier to manage at scale.

### 4.1.3.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.3.1.0 Pattern Name

Secure Cloud Access via OIDC

#### 4.1.3.2.0 Pattern Application

Workflows authenticate with cloud providers (AWS) by exchanging a GitHub-issued OIDC token for temporary cloud credentials, eliminating the need for storing long-lived secrets.

#### 4.1.3.3.0 Required Components

- ci.yml (permissions block)
- cd.yml (permissions block)
- aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials action

#### 4.1.3.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Configure a trust relationship between GitHub and the AWS IAM identity provider. In each job requiring cloud access, set 'permissions: id-token: write' and use the official AWS action to assume an IAM role.

#### 4.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the industry-standard best practice for security, directly fulfilling the core of the Security NFR by removing static access keys from the CI/CD environment.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by synthesizing the repository's description with system-wide requirements (REQ-1-086, REQ-1-093, REQ-1-081), architectural patterns (Microservices, Cloud-Native), quality attributes (Security, Maintainability), and relevant sequence diagrams (SEQ-84 for artifact delivery). The provided technology-specific instructions for GitHub Actions were used as a blueprint for the implementation strategy.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision to mandate reusable workflows was driven by the Microservices architecture and Maintainability NFR.
- Decision to mandate OIDC for all cloud access was driven by the Security NFR (REQ-1-081) and modern best practices.
- Decision to structure the repository based on GitHub Actions conventions ('.github/workflows/reusable/') was based on the provided technology integration guide.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumed that the target container registry is AWS ECR, consistent with the AWS EKS deployment target.
- Assumed that a security scanning tool like Snyk or Trivy will be used, as it is a standard practice and mentioned in the guiding instructions.
- Assumed self-hosted runners might be necessary for performance or network security, and planned for scalability with solutions like 'actions-runner-controller'.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that the CI/CD automation requirement (REQ-1-086) is consistent with the choice of GitHub Actions in the architecture (REQ-1-089).
- Cross-referenced the security quality attribute with REQ-1-081 (secrets management) to confirm the necessity of the OIDC pattern.
- Ensured the deployment strategy (Helm to EKS) is consistent with the Cloud-Native architectural pattern described in the architecture document.
