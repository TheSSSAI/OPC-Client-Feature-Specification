## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-086

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

To ensure maintainability, all backend code must have a minimum of 80% unit test coverage, enforced by the CI/CD pipeline. The system shall be built using a microservices architecture, with services fronted by the Kong API Gateway for routing, authentication, and rate limiting. All external REST APIs must be documented using the OpenAPI specification.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- The CI pipeline for any backend service fails if unit test coverage is below 80%.
- Workflows exist to build, test, and deploy all services and the frontend.
- Workflows enforce quality gates like static analysis and security scanning.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- GitHub Actions workflows must be created to define the CI/CD processes for all application repositories.
- CI workflows triggered by pull requests must include jobs for code checkout, dependency installation, building, static analysis, security scanning, and running unit tests with coverage checks.
- CD workflows triggered by merges to main must include jobs for building and pushing container images, and deploying to the staging/production environments.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement represents the core mission of the REPO-CICD-PIPELINES repository, which is explicitly tasked with automating the entire build, test, and deployment lifecycle and enforcing quality gates like test coverage.
