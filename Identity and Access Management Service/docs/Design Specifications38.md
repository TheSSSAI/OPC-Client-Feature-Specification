# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Authoritative source for managing the lifecycle of tenants, users, roles, and application-specific permissions.
- Manages data isolation configuration, software licensing, user profiles, role assignments, and asset-scoped access control.
- Explicitly excludes user authentication (password management, token issuance), which is delegated to Keycloak.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- .NET v8.0, ASP.NET Core v8.0, Entity Framework Core v8.0.6
- PostgreSQL 16 for persistence.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must operate within a multi-tenant SaaS architecture, enforcing strict data isolation between tenants via row-level security.
- Must be a stateless, containerized microservice deployable on Kubernetes (EKS) to support horizontal scalability.
- Must integrate with Keycloak as the external Identity Provider (IdP) for authentication, consuming its JWTs for authorization.

# 7.0.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Performance Bottleneck

### 7.1.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The centralized, synchronous authorization check pattern can make the IAM service a single point of failure and a performance bottleneck for the entire system.

### 7.1.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

High. If authorization checks are slow, every dependent service will be slow. The service must be designed for very high throughput and low latency.

### 7.1.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is common in microservices but requires careful implementation. A multi-layered caching strategy (in-memory, distributed Redis) is not optional, it is a core requirement for this service to be viable.

## 7.2.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Data Consistency

### 7.2.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

User and asset data is distributed. The IAM service stores user profile info and asset scope IDs, while Keycloak owns the core user identity and Asset Service owns the asset definitions.

### 7.2.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

Medium. There is a risk of data becoming inconsistent (e.g., a user is deleted in Keycloak but not in the IAM service's database).

### 7.2.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

Medium

### 7.2.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

A strategy for data synchronization is required. This could involve using webhooks from Keycloak (if available) or running periodic reconciliation background jobs to ensure consistency between the IdP and the local user profile store.

# 8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis is based on the repository description, the overall 'Microservices' architecture (ID: ARCHITECTURE), the 'Core Identity, Tenancy & Governance' ERD (ID: 25), and several sequence diagrams, primarily 'User Auth' (ID: 71), 'Protected API' (ID: 77), and 'Notification Preferences' (ID: 97).

## 8.2.0.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision to exclude authentication logic was based on the explicit mention of Keycloak in the repository description and REQ-1-080.
- Decision to emphasize caching for authorization was based on the performance implications of the synchronous check pattern seen in Sequence ID 77.
- Decision to use EF Core global query filters was based on the strong multi-tenancy requirement (REQ-1-025) and is a best practice for preventing data leakage.

## 8.3.0.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumed that the 'userId' in the local database will correspond to the 'sub' claim in the Keycloak JWT for reliable linking.
- Assumed that other services will call this IAM service for fine-grained, resource-scoped permissions that cannot be encoded in a JWT.
- Assumed that the database ERD in ID:25 is the target schema for this service's primary data model.

## 8.4.0.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Cross-referenced the repository description's claim of managing tenants, users, and roles with the entities present in ERD id:25.
- Verified the service's placement behind the API Gateway against the overall architecture diagram.
- Validated the need for user preference management by linking REQ-FR-022 to the detailed interaction in Sequence ID 97.
