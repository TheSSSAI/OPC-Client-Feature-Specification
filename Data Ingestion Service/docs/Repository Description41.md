# 2 Name

Data Ingestion Service

# 3 Description

This microservice is a highly specialized, high-throughput component designed for one critical purpose: ingesting massive volumes of real-time time-series data from the distributed OPC Core Clients. As specified in REQ-1-010, it exposes a gRPC endpoint with mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure, low-latency, and efficient binary communication. Its sole responsibility is to receive data streams, perform minimal validation and transformation, and efficiently batch-write the data into the TimescaleDB time-series database. The service must be architected to meet the demanding performance requirement of ingesting up to 10,000 values per second per tenant (REQ-1-075) and must be horizontally scalable to handle the load from up to 10,000 client instances (REQ-NFR-005).

# 22.0.0 Integration Patterns

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Dependency Injection | Constructor Injection via .NET's DI container. |
| Event Communication | N/A |
| Data Flow | Bi-directional gRPC stream. |
| Error Handling | Return gRPC status codes to the client on failure.... |
| Async Patterns | Full async pipeline from gRPC stream reading to da... |

# 23.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 23.1.0 Must Implement

- Expose a secure gRPC endpoint for data streaming.
- Authenticate clients via mTLS certificates.
- Receive, decode, and batch Process Protocol Buffer messages.
- Perform high-performance bulk writes to TimescaleDB.
- Be fully stateless for horizontal scaling.

## 23.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Expose any REST APIs.
- Handle command and control logic (this is MQTT).
- Perform complex business logic or data enrichment.
- Query any data.

## 23.3.0 Integration Points

- Listens for incoming gRPC connections from OPC Core Clients.
- Connects to the TimescaleDB cluster.

## 23.4.0 Architectural Constraints

- Must use gRPC, not REST, for its primary interface.
- The data writing process must be heavily optimized for throughput.

# 24.0.0 Technology Standards

## 24.1.0 Framework Specific

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pattern Usage | Implement the gRPC service using Grpc.AspNetCore. ... |
| Performance Requirements | Must sustain 10,000 writes/sec/tenant. |
| Security Requirements | Must enforce mTLS for all client connections. |

# 25.0.0 Cognitive Load Instructions

## 25.1.0 Sds Generation Guidance

### 25.1.1 Focus Areas

- The Protocol Buffer schema definition for the data stream.
- The high-performance batching and database writing strategy.
- Scalability design using Kubernetes HPA.

### 25.1.2 Avoid Patterns

- Writing data row-by-row to the database.
- Adding any synchronous dependencies to other services.

## 25.2.0 Code Generation Guidance

### 25.2.1 Implementation Patterns

- Generate C# gRPC stubs from the `.proto` file.
- Use concurrent collections and background tasks to implement the batching mechanism.
