# API Gateway Configuration: Ingress for Device Management Service
#
# This Ingress resource defines the public-facing API routes for the Device Management Service.
# It handles all requests related to the lifecycle of OPC Core Client instances, including
# provisioning, configuration pushes, and remote software updates.
#
# Applied Policies (Plugins):
# - cors-policy: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for the frontend application.
# - global-jwt-validation: Enforces that all requests must have a valid JWT from Keycloak.
# - global-rate-limiting: Protects the service from excessive requests.
#
# Requirements Fulfilled: REQ-1-086 (Unified API), REQ-1-080 (Security), REQ-1-005 (Remote Management)
